With over a decade of experience in product management, I’ve led teams and launched products across developer tooling, AI, telecom, and media — from video platforms and eSIM systems to tools now used daily by millions of developers. I’m currently a Principal Product Manager at Docker, where I focus on AI infrastructure — including the launch of the MCP Catalog, the open-sourcing of the MCP Gateway, and ongoing work on agent frameworks and Gordon, Docker’s AI assistant.

In parallel, I maintain Blowfish (a popular open-source Hugo theme), advise early-stage startups on product and go-to-market strategy, and mentor aspiring and working PMs. I enjoy writing, experimenting, and helping others build with more clarity, confidence, and care.
