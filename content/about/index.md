With over a decade of experience in product management, I’ve led teams and launched products across developer tooling, AI, telecom, and media — from video platforms and eSIM systems to tools now used daily by millions of developers. I’m currently a Principal Product Manager at Docker, where I focus on AI — including open-sourcing [cagent](https://github.com/docker/cagent), a CLI and runtime for orchestrating AI agents, the launch of the [Docker's MCP Catalog](https://github.com/docker/mcp-registry), and open-sourcing of the [MCP Gateway](https://github.com/docker/mcp-gateway).

In parallel, I maintain [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page) (a popular open-source Hugo theme), advise early-stage startups on product and go-to-market strategy, and mentor aspiring and working PMs. I enjoy writing, experimenting, and helping others build with more clarity, confidence, and care.
