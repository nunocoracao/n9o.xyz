## What is Blitzscaling?
Blitzscaling is a term coined by entrepreneur and investor [Reid Hoffman][1], which refers to a strategy for rapidly scaling up a company in a short period. The idea behind blitzscaling is to prioritize growth over profitability, aiming to dominate a market and become a category leader. While blitzscaling can lead to significant success for companies, it also has some significant downsides.

One of the reasons why this approach works is that it allows companies to grow rapidly and capture market share before competitors can catch up. By investing heavily in growth, companies can create network effects, build brand recognition, and attract customers before competitors can establish themselves in the market. This can create a virtuous cycle, where growth begets more growth, and the company becomes dominant in its market.

## Downsides
One of the biggest downsides of blitzscaling is that it can lead to burnout for employees and the company itself. By prioritizing growth over profitability, companies can quickly accumulate debt and become over-leveraged, which can lead to financial instability. Additionally, the pressure to grow quickly can result in a toxic company culture, where employees are overworked and unappreciated, leading to high turnover rates and difficulty attracting top talent.

Blitzscaling has also contributed to the creation of some problems in the tech industry. For example, some companies have prioritized growth at the expense of ethical considerations, leading to negative outcomes for users and society as a whole. For example, [Uber's][2] rapid growth was accompanied by reports of unethical business practices, such as aggressive expansion into new markets and mistreatment of drivers. Similarly, [Facebook's][3] growth was accompanied by a failure to address issues such as fake news, hate speech, and privacy concerns, which have had negative impacts on society.

## Awesome When It Works
On the other hand, some companies have successfully used blitzscaling to create positive outcomes for both themselves and society. For example, [Amazon's][4] rapid growth allowed it to become a dominant player in e-commerce, which has had significant benefits for consumers in terms of convenience and affordability. Similarly, [Google's][5] rapid growth allowed it to create innovative products and services that have positively impacted society, such as Google Maps, Gmail, and Google Translate.

## Final Thoughts
In conclusion, while blitzscaling can be an effective strategy for rapidly scaling up a company, it also has significant downsides that should not be ignored. The pressure to prioritize growth over profitability can lead to burnout, financial instability, and toxic company culture. Additionally, the pursuit of growth can lead to unethical behavior and negative outcomes for users and society. 

Ultimately, companies should carefully consider the trade-offs of blitzscaling and ensure that they prioritize sustainable growth that benefits all stakeholders, rather than simply prioritizing growth at all costs. More than that, it should be clear that _scaling_ a company, with or without blitzscaling, should come after there is a proven strategy to scale. Otherwise, not only there are risks in scaling fast, but also in scaling something which was never proven.
