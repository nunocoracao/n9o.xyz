## The Challenge

Starting tomorrow, I'm embarking on a 30-day challenge to build and ship a project every single day using AI-assisted coding — or as I like to call it, **vibe coding**.

## Why?

- **Learning:** Push myself to explore new technologies and ideas
- **Documenting:** Share the journey, the wins, and the failures
- **Shipping:** Actually finish things and put them out in the world

## The Rules

1. **One project per day** — no exceptions
2. **Must ship** — deploy to production, make it accessible
3. **Document everything** — blog post + social media
4. **Use AI assistance** — embrace the tools, learn to collaborate with AI

## What to Expect

Everything will be rough. Some projects will be tiny. Some might be ambitious failures. That's the point.

I'll be sharing daily updates on social media and weekly digest posts here on the blog covering 7 projects at a time.

## Follow Along

- **GitHub:** All projects will be linked from [the index repo](https://github.com/nunocoracao/30DaysOfVibeCoding)
- **Social:** #30DaysOfVibeCoding on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/nunocoracao), [X](https://x.com/nunocoracao), and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/nunocoracao.com)
- **Blog:** Weekly digests right here

Let's see what happens. Day 1 starts tomorrow.
