As I sit down to write this on the first day of 2026, I find myself looking back at what has been an extraordinary year for Blowfish. What started as a personal project to build my own Hugo theme has grown into something I never imagined - a thriving open-source community with contributors from all around the world.

## By the Numbers

2025 was a year of significant growth. Here's where we stand:

- **2,500+ stars** on GitHub (up from around 600 when I wrote the first tutorial in late 2023)
- **645 forks** of the repository
- **241 contributors** who have helped shape Blowfish
- **3,928 commits** to the main branch
- **1,390 merged pull requests**
- **16 releases** throughout the year (v2.81.0 to v2.94.0)

These numbers represent real people who chose to use Blowfish for their personal sites, blogs, and portfolios. Every star, every fork, every contribution tells a story of someone who found value in this project. That means the world to me.

## Feature Highlights

We shipped a lot of new functionality this year. Here are some of the highlights:

### New Shortcodes

- **Gallery** - Beautiful image galleries out of the box
- **Gist** - Embed GitHub gists directly in your content
- **Video** - Native video embedding support

### Visual Enhancements
- **GitHub Alerts/Admonitions** - Those nice callout boxes you see on GitHub READMEs? Now available in Blowfish
- **Full Chroma customization** - Complete control over syntax highlighting themes

- **Mermaid dark mode** - Diagrams now respect your theme's dark mode

### Developer Experience

Now averaging 600+ downloads per month on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blowfish-tools).

### Accessibility & User Experience

### Internationalization
This year we added support for several new languages including Indonesian, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese (both PT and BR), Thai, and Ukrainian. A huge thank you to all the translators who made Blowfish accessible to more people around the world.

## A Milestone Moment

One of the most significant moments of 2025 came in October when I welcomed [@ZhenShuo2021](https://github.com/ZhenShuo2021) as Blowfish's first official collaborator.

Building an open-source project can sometimes feel like a solitary journey. Having someone step up to share the maintenance load, review PRs, and help guide the project's direction is invaluable. This marks a new chapter for Blowfish - one where the project is bigger than just one person.

## The Community

Beyond the code, what makes Blowfish special is its community. The GitHub Discussions have become a place where users help each other, share their sites, and propose new ideas. The Q&A section is active, with community members jumping in to answer questions before I even get a chance to look at them.

I've seen Blowfish used for personal blogs, developer portfolios, documentation sites, and everything in between. Every time someone shares their site in the ["Show and Tell"](https://blowfish.page/users/) section, I'm reminded why I started this project in the first place.

## Looking Forward

As we head into 2026, I'm excited about what's next. The foundation we've built is solid, and with a growing team of contributors, we can take Blowfish even further. There are new features on the roadmap, performance improvements to make, and always more ways to make the theme more accessible and easier to use.

If you're using Blowfish, I'd love to see what you've built. Drop by the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish/discussions) and share your site. If you've got ideas for new features or improvements, open an issue or join the conversation.
